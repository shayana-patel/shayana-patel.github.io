        <h3>10 September 2021</h3>
        <br>
        <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
        <h3 class="blog-subheadings">My Goals</h3>
        <p>My long-term goal is to work as web-developer in a company that shares the same values as I do. I would love a job that allows me to work in an office with others, but also have the flexibility to work remotely. My ideal job would also be working for a company that encourages continuous learning and professional development. I would also like to continue my learning journey and learn other coding languages and work on continually upskilling myself.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="blog-subheadings">Strengths and Limitations in Relation to Learning</h3>
        <p>Some of my strengths in relation to learning is that I am hard-working, and I have a growth mindset. I always try my best and am committed learning and understand that even when I don’t understand it straight away that with some perseverance I can succeed. Ultimately, I know that any setbacks I experience, will help me improve in the long run.</p>
        <p>My limitations that could negatively impact my learning is that I am a perfectionist and prone to burnout. Because I am a perfectionist, I tend to get bogged down by details and spend too much time making sure that everything is completed without any errors/mistakes and to a high standard. This tends to slow me down a bit. I find it hard to just walk away from something without completing it first, and often neglect to take breaks so that I can get the work done.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="blog-subheadings">Core Skill Developemt</h3>
        <p>The non-technical skills I would like to develop while at Dev Academy are communication, problem-solving skills, and my self-belief/confidence levels. I am an extremely shy and reserved person and have always struggled with verbal communication when I meet new people. I would also like to develop my problem-solving skills – in my previous job, although there were aspects in which we had to find solutions ourselves, most solutions to problems we encountered where already set out in our standard operating procedures manuals. I am hoping this course will allow me to develop my ability to think outside of the box when solving problems. Finally, I would like to work on my self-belief/confidence levels because whenever I try something new, I always have that little voice in my head that tells me I can’t do it, and this tends to make me feel less confident in my abilities.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="blog-subheadings">Committment to Learning</h3>
        <p>To ensure that I manage my workload productively and safely, I have created a timetable in which I have scheduled in the times I will focus on work, as well as planned breaks. When I'm in the “zone” I can often work for hours without taking a break. I have been sure to schedule in breaks and start using a timer to remind me to take time away from my desk, that way I don’t burn myself out</p>
        <p>When in stressful situations and things start getting to me, my plan is to go and do something that relaxes me and will take my mind off whatever is causing me to stress out, i.e., meditate for 10 minutes, make myself a snack, or go do some exercise. Also reach out to somebody – this one is probably going to be tough for me as I don’t like to burden others with my problems.</p>
        <p>When I am struggling with something, if I haven’t been able to find the answer/resolve the issue within 20-30 mins by myself though researching, I will reach out to my peers in the Foundations Channel in Slack, or DM my facilitator if required.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="blog-subheadings">Expectations for the Facilitation Team</h3>
        <p>The two main expectations I have for the facilitation team are for them to be encouraging and to be honest when giving criticism, but also offering advice on ways to improve.</p>
