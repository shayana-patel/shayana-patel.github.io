        <h2>Display Inline vs Inline-Block vs Block: What's the difference?</h2>
        <p>This blog will be explore what it means to display inline, inline-block, and block.
            First thing to know is that the <span><em>display</em></span> property determines how HTML elements are are going to be arranged on a website.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3 id="inline">Display: Inline<h3>
        <p class="description">Elements are arranged on the same line and only take up as much width as necessary. However they are not effected by width and height changes but are by margin and padding changes.
           Changes to margin and padding only effects the elements next to it along the horizontal plain i.e. if they are increased
           the element will push elements on the left and right away, but element would then overlap the element on the lines above and below it.</p>
